I have great learning ability, and I also have a strong willingness to learn. Also, I am a self-disciplined person and a morning bird. You know, as a Chinese saying goes, the morning hour is the best time of the day. I prefer to get up early in the morning to recite words and do some reading.

示范回答 2:
Yes. I love challenges and I am not afraid of them, especially in the area of studies, and I can deal with challenges. I often share my study experiences with my classmates, such as Chinese and English. When doing this, I have a great sense of achievement.`

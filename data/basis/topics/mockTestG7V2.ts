                    example: `This is a very interesting black and white drawing. It shows a human-like robot sitting at a computer. The robot looks like a person from the side, but the top of its head is open, showing wires and computer parts inside. This tells us it's a robot.

The robot is looking at the computer screen. On the screen, there is an "I'm not a robot" check. This is very funny and strange because the character is actually a robot trying to pass a test that is made to stop robots.

At the bottom of the picture, there are words that say, "You can do this, Sophia." This name could be for Sophia, a famous real robot. The message sounds like nice words to help her. It could be from a person watching, or maybe it's the robot's own thought, which makes the picture more interesting.

This picture makes me think about the future of AI. It makes us ask, "What does it mean to be human?" and "How can we tell the difference between people and smart robots?" It's a smart and funny way to show a difficult idea.`

Some people choose to ride a bike or take the bus to help reduce ({3}). Others plant trees and use less ({4}) to save energy. If everyone makes a small ({5}), the world will become cleaner and greener.",

                        answer: 'save', 
                        explanation: '“save the environment” 是一个固定搭配，意为“拯救环境”或“保护环境”。选项 “hurt”（伤害）与句意相反，而“forget”（忘记）在上下文中不合逻辑。因此，正确答案是 save。'

                        answer: 'air', 
                        explanation: '后文提到“too many cars”（太多的汽车），汽车是造成空气问题（air problems）或空气污染的主要原因。虽然汽车也可能导致水和土地污染，但空气问题是与汽车最直接和最相关的问题。因此，正确答案是 air。'

                        explanation: '骑自行车或乘坐公共汽车是为了“reduce pollution”（减少污染）。选项 “population”（人口）和 “vacation”（假期）与环保出行的目的无关。因此，正确答案是 pollution。'

                        answer: 'electricity', 
                        explanation: '句子的目标是“to save energy”（节约能源）。少用“electricity”（电）是节约能源的一种直接方式。选项 “rice”（米饭）是食物，与能源无关；而“sunlight”（阳光）是自然能源，人们通常不会通过“少用”它来节约能源。因此，正确答案是 electricity。'

                        answer: 'effort', 
                        explanation: '“make a small effort” 是一个固定搭配，意为“付出一份小小的努力”。这句话的意思是如果每个人都贡献一份力量，世界就会变得更好。选项 “mistake”（错误）和 “rule”（规则）放入句中语义不通。因此，正确答案是 effort。'

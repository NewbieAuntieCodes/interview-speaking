I won the first prize in the ... competition. I was thrilled. I was over the moon. My hard work finally paid off.

Disappointed/Embarrassed Moment:
When: I was about 10 years old.
Who & Where: My dad and I went to a museum.
What: We were looking at an exhibition and I grabbed the side of his shirt and acted like I blew my nose on it and said I missed our cats at home. But when I looked up it was not my dad! It was some other guy that was there with his family. He was wearing the same color of shirt as my dad was. I looked at him and said sorry and that I really didn't blow my nose on him, then ran to find my dad who was in the next room. I was crying by then and told my dad I was mad at him for moving and not telling me, then told him what happened. My dad giggled, but said he'd hold my hand so I would know where he was from now on.
How I felt: I saw the man later and he just smiled at me, but I was dying of embarrassment!

Failing Moment:
What happened: fail to catch the flight
Who: my parents and I
Where: We planned to pay a visit to Hawaii and spent our Christmas there. We really looked forward to this tour and had arranged everything beforehand.
Why: But on the day we left, we couldn't make it to the airport on time because it was raining heavily, and we were totally stuck on the road. At last, we had to cancel the flight.
How we feel: All of us were super upset.`

2: A suit. It's navy-blue, and it is really sharp-looking and well-fitted. The cut and design were so exquisite, stylish and expensive-looking. I have to say, I look very handsome and dapper in this suit. The whole outfit is so elegant and tasteful, I love it.

Place Where You Live:
I live in an apartment near the city center. I live on the 16th floor. There is a subway station near my apartment. And there is a hospital around the corner. My neighborhood is peaceful and safe.

Happiness:
(思路: positive vs negative; optimistic vs. pessimistic)
